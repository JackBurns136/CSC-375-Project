# CSC-375

## What is this project?

This project is an open-source database that can be used to store images.  
I am using Node.js as the runtime environment and JavaScript to code the project.
SQLite is the database program used to hold the images.
HTML and CSS for the framework for the front end of the project

## Agenda
    Crop the images to make them all uniform
    Add more images
