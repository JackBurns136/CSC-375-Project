# CSC-375

## What is this project?

This project is an open-source database that can be used to store images.  
At the moment it is used for a game called Guess that Forehead but it can be changed to accommodate whatever project that needs a database of images 
I am using Node.js as the runtime environment and JavaScript to code the project.
SQLite is the database program used to hold the images.
HTML and CSS for the framework for the front end of the project
All extra dependencies are stored in the package.json and to upload that is an npm install

## Agenda
    Crop the images to make them all uniform
    Add more images
    Rework the random showing of images as it repeats
    Allow the enter button to also submit the user's answers
