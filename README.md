# CSC-375

## What is this project?

This project is an open-source database that can be used to store images.  
I am using Node.js as the runtime environment and obviously JavaScript to code the project.
SQLite is the database program used to hold the images.

## Agenda
    Connect the website to the backend database
    have a way for the textbox to know who is on screen so it can display if the answer is correct or not
    crop the images to use
