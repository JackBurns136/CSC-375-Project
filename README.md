# CSC-375

## What is this project?

This project is an open-source database that can be used to store images.  
I am using Node.js as the runtime environment and obviously JavaScript to code the project.
SQLite is the database program used to hold the images.

## Agenda
    Write a function to better write the database to a website
    Find the best way to have images in a database (store images outside of the database with a link to the image stored in the DB)
